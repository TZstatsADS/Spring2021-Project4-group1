+ Project summary: This project aims to explore different algorithms for causal inference. Causal inference refers to the process of drawing a conclusion about a causal connection based on the conditions of the occurrence of an effect. The goal is to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) in detail through implementation (using R), evaluation, and comparison. The algorithms include **Inverse Propensity Weighting**, **Doubly Robust Estimation**, and **Regression Estimate**. For the first two algorithms, we also had to compute propensity score using classification and regression trees (CART). To evaluate our algorithms, we were given two data sets (low-dimensional and high-dimensional) as well as correct ATE.

**Project Result for High-dimenssional data**
